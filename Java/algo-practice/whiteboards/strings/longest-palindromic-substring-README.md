# Strings - Longest Palindromic Substring

## Features

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The Big O time complexity for the is O(n^3), and the space complexity is O(n).
