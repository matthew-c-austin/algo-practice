# Strings - Semordnilap

## Features

Write a function that takes in a list of unique strings and returns a list of semordnilap pairs.

A semordnilap pair is defined as a set of different strings where the reverse of one word is the same as the forward version of the other. For example the words "diaper" and "repaid" are a semordnilap pair, as are the words "palindromes" and "semordnilap".

The order of the returned pairs and the order of the strings within each pair does not matter.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The Big O time complexity for the is O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word. The space complexity is also O(n * m).
