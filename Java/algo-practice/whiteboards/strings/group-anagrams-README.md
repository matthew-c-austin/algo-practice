# Strings - Group Anagrams

## Features

Write a function that takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams together.

Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters, when order doesn't matter. For example,
"cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly, "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.

Your function should return a list of anagram groups in no particular order.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The Big O time complexity for the is O(w * n * log(n)), where w is the number of words and n is the length of the longest word, and the space complexity is O(wn).
