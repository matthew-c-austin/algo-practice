# Strings - First Non-Repeating Character

## Features

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

The first non-repeating character is tthe first character in a string that occurs only once.

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function should return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The Big O time complexity for the is O(n), as we traverse the total number of characters. The space complexity is O(1), the input string only has lowercase English-alphabet characters, which limits it to 26 at most.
